## MoMoNet metrics
During training and evaluation, the metrics of the model are stored in a history at each epoch in a matrix of dimensions $(E+1) * D$, where E is the number of encoders and D the number of decoders. Each row represents the metrics for a target at each state of the model.

## Code structure
### MoMoNet
`/momonet` package contains the MoMoNet model and its modules:
* Encoders
* Decoders
* State

### Datasets
`/dataset` package contains the MoMoDataset abstract class, compatible with MoMoNet.

Specific **datasets** are added in the `/dataset` directory and must fulfill the following requirements:
* Contain a dataset class that inherit MoMoDataset or has a method to convert into a MoMoDataset
* Contain a `.sh` script responsible of getting the data and store it in `/data` folder

`__getitem__` function of MoMoDataset subclasses must yield elements of the following shape:

```
tuple
(
	data: [torch.Tensor],
	targets: numpy.ndarray,
	(optional) encoding_sequence: numpy.ndarray
)
```

namely a tuple containing an array of tensors representing the features for each subsequent encoder, a numpy array representing the different targets and optionally a numpy array giving the order in which to apply the encoders to the subsequent data tensors. Note: `data` and `encoding_sequence` must have the same length.

#### **Missing values**
The user should be able to choose to keep missing values (nan values). Missing values can be present in the tensors yielded by the dataset and are managed by MoMoNet.
